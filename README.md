# Flight-passengers-prediction
Kaggle competition: The case of flight passengers prediction. A project for the subject: Data Mining &amp; Web Mining
A classification problem in which we must predict the class of flight. We implement many models like RandomForest, KNN, SVM, 
Logistic Regression. But the best approach was the creation of a multilayer neural network using Keras.
